##Not done yet. Still very much a draft.

When you work on something you think is worthwhile, maybe even a little fun, you can't help wanting to share it with everyone. It feels great to make stuff, and you want to see people use that stuff—it stokes the maker's ego.

After all, we usually feel the best when we make stuff for other people.

After teaching myself iOS development for a few months, I decided it was time to make something on my own. Over Winter break, away from school and using all my accumulated knowledge, I made an app using the [Product Hunt API](http://www.producthunt.com/v1/oauth/applications "Product Hunt API Dashboard"). It's called [Time Machine](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/product-hunt-time-machine/id956311358 "App Store") and it allows you to jump back to any past day on Product Hunt.

When I completed the first version, I really wanted to share it with some people. I sent out a couple invites to my friends, but I was really proud of this thing. I had just learned iOS development and made an app I thought was super useful and well done.

So, I sent an emal to Ryan Hoover, Founder of Product Hunt.

I kept it short and sweet. And just waited.

Now was my self-proclaimed moment of glory. Jumped over to TestFlight on iTunes Connect and sent out an invite right away.

Again I waited. Not really sure what I was waiting for. I guess no news is good news until I got this.

I felt like I blew it. Because I did. I quickly responded.

This is probably the worst feeling you could possibly get---making something that breaks, fails, or gets rejected. It's part of you because you spend so much time on it. It really feels like part of you is getting injured.

If we think about his from a different perspective. Let's say that I was sending my product to an investor or journalist. This would probably be my only shot with that person. If it failed like that, it would have been over.

I eventually squashed the bug and had a great learning experience in the process.
