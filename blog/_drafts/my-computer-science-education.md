title: "My Computer Science *Education*"
---

Just over four years ago---around the time I was finalizing what college to spend the next four years of my life at---I decided to study computer science.

My mom received her master's degree in computer science and mathematics so it sounded like an interesting and challenging thing to study. Plus, everyone sounded impressed whenever I said I was majoring in computer science.

When I was younger, I enjoyed doodling in [Microsoft Paint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint_(software) "Paint, my favorite Microsoft product."), clicking around to figure out what everything did, and learning different keyboard shortcuts and tricks. My most advanced escapades consisted of building [GeoCities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities "GeoCities wiki") sites with my brother. It was all really fun, but hardly contained the qualifications of a computer scientist, which didn't really matter because I was ten years old.

Somewhere, lost between dial tones, Windows 98, and CS 1101: *Introduction to Program Design*, that joy faded for a while.

## CS 1101: Introduction to Program Design
Struggles with computer science.
First thing I really had tons of trouble with academically. Struggled through CS 1101, failed CS 2103 (whatever the object-oriented course number is). I thought I was not right for CS. I never considered that I needed more time.
There's a component of luck.

## Sophomore Year
Switzerland
Time off from coding.
Summer: did some HTML/CSS

## Junior Year
Summer internship got me interested in startups again (reference Hack to Start Interview)
Talked about startups, while spending time at the cube farm. Recognize that it was a great experience though -- learning about how to act professionally.
Lot's of people hate on TechCrunch for romanticizing startups too much. The ironic thing was TC got me interested in them.
The importance of design.
Started to code again (LPTHW, codecademy python, Bob help, Internet)
Discovered YC and Paul Graham's essays
CS 1101 linked to one of PG's essays
Startup School

## Senior Year
Have self-confidence in yourself because no one else will believe in you like you can. Belief is a powerful thing -- if you see someone do something, you know it's possible. No one really pays that much attention to you, they're always too worried about themselves.
Product Hunt
Learning Swift & iOS

Just like me, my computer science is little raw around the edges. Ask me about theory, I may or may not know what you are talking about. Even though it's unconventional, I love how I learned computer science. Without the formal software engineering training, I just jump into problems without thinking too much about the technical challenges. This inherent optimism is a good and bad thing: I might not finish a project because I hadn't recognized a roadblock before I started, but I'm not scared to start. I make stuff.
