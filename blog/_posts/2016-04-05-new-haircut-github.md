An early adopter's badge of honor, short usernames are typically taken when sites start to gain popularity. After joining [GitHub](https://github.com) on February 22, 2014, I chose a long username---fortunately, I didn't have to settle for it.

GitHub is one of the few sites that has a [policy](https://help.github.com/articles/name-squatting-policy/) of releasing dormant usernames, and luckily there are plenty of them!

Now, I have [@tmm](https://github.com/tmm).

#### But how?

First, I looked for users that joined GitHub early on (2011 and before) and had little to no publicly activity (commits, repositories, and followers/following). Then, all I had to do was contact [GitHub Support](https://github.com/contact) with the username I wanted.

And it worked.
