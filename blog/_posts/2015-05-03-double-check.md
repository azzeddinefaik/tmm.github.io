When you work on something you think is worthwhile, you can't help wanting to share it with the world. It feels great to make things, and you want to see other people use those things—it strokes your maker's ego.

After all, we usually feel best when we make stuff for other people.

I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.

After teaching myself iOS development for a few months, I decided it was time to make something on my own. Over winter break, using my accumulated knowledge, I made an app using the [Product Hunt API](http://www.producthunt.com/v1/oauth/applications "Product Hunt API Dashboard"). The resulting, [Time Machine](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/product-hunt-time-machine/id956311358 "App Store"), allows you to quickly jump to any day on Product Hunt and view the products.

##Proud & Impatient

When the first version was complete, my initial thought was to share it and get feedback. I sent invites to friends and impatiently waited a few hours, but I didn't hear anything back. I had learned iOS development *and* made an useful app.

I was really proud of myself.

Maybe a little too proud

Thinking of people that would find Time Machine relevant and useful, I sent an email to Ryan Hoover, Founder of Product Hunt.

Keeping it succinct---I waited for a reply.

Now was my self-proclaimed moment of glory! I quickly jumped over to TestFlight on iTunes Connect and sent him an invite.

Again, I waited. Not really sure what I was waiting for.

(That's a lie.)

I was waiting for another message to make its way to my inbox. A message that included a congratulatory comment or some other type of feel good response. Something to stroke my maker's ego.

Instead, my inbox received a different message.

I felt like I blew it. Maybe I did. I quickly responded.

Without a doubt the worst feeling you can possibly get is making something that breaks, fails, and/or gets rejected. For better or worse, when you spend time on something, it becomes part of you. And when it doesn't meet expectations, let alone work, that part of you hurts a little bit.

Eventually everything worked out. The bug was squashed, Time Machine was successfully [featured on Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/posts/product-hunt-timemachine), and I learned an extremely valuable lesson:

>If I was sending Time Machine to an investor or journalist to look at, this would have been my only shot. Not only would the app not work, but it would have reflected poorly on me.

Yes, it's important to ship quickly and get feedback. But don't forget to sweat the details and double check.
