>The Quick Brown Fox Jumped Over The Lazy Dogs

Take a look. That sentence contains every letter in the English alphabet. In elementary school, I took a computer typing class. This was in the late 1990s, and besides getting to type: "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs" a bunch of times, the world of computers was introduced to me. 

Now---enough nostalgia.

If you are interested in the way things work---whether mechanical, technological, or in any other way---this style guide may interest you. Within, I will simply *guide* you through the structure and semantics that comprise my blog's *styles*. Mainly, it serves as a reminder to keep me in check while I am crafting the posts you find here. Hopefully, along our brief journey, we learn something together.

##Let's Talk About Headings & Typography##

That was a level two heading, affectionately known as "h2" in the browser world. Level two headings split content into sections. Level one headings serve as titles and appear only once per post. Headings and captions are set sans serif in [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/ "Lato") by Łukasz Dziedzic, while everything else is in Impallari Type's [Libre Baskerville](http://www.impallari.com/projects/overview/libre-baskerville "Libre Baskerville") (a delightful serif).

You may have noticed that links are a [light-gray color]() with an underline---they turn green when you hover over them. Speaking of the color green, block quotes are just that.

>The gods envy us. They envy us because we’re mortal, because any moment may be our last. Everything is more beautiful because we’re doomed.

There are three different image styles: normal, full, and bleed. All images usually have captions for providing context. Full and bleed look the same on mobile devices. *Lorem Ipsum* is used between the images to demonstrate their unique layout effects. [^1]

Isn't that horizontal rule really neat? The three-asterisk style was something I picked up from my favorite designer/writer, Frank Chimero. His essay, [*The Web's Grain*](http://frankchimero.com/talks/the-webs-grain/transcript/ "The Web's Grain by Frank Chimero"), is worth checking out---like right now.

Now let's finish up.

###Here Are Some Lists###

That was a level three heading. Level three headings aren't used very much, but they are still kept in my toolkit. Next, you'll see an ordered and unordered list. Lists aren't used all that much either. 

1. Milk
2. Eggs
3. Cheese

- Paper beats rock
- Rock beats scissors
  - Sub-bullet
- Scissors beats paper

Footnotes are at the bottom. And by clicking on the magical number two at the end of this line, you will be instantaneously transported there. [^2]


>The End.

###Notes###

Footnotes go in this section, along with any other notes I may have for you, the reader.

[^1]: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
[^2]: I am just a footnote.
