##The Quick Brown Fox Jumped Over The Lazy Dogs##

That sentence contains every letter in the English alphabet. When I was in elementary school, I took computer typing. This was in the late 1990s, and besides getting to type: "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs" a lot of times, the world of computers was introduced to me. 

Now, enough nostalgia.

If you are interested in the way things work---whether mechanical, technological, or in any other way---this style guide may interest you. Within, I will simply *guide* you through the structure and semantics that comprise my blog's *styles*. Mainly, it serves as a reminder to keep me in check while I am crafting the posts you find here. Hopefully, along our brief journey, we learn something together.

##I Am The Guide, And You Are My First Mate##

That was a level two heading, affectionately known as "h2" in the browser world. Level two headings split content into sections and are used quite frequently. A level one heading serves as the title and appears only once per post. Headings, along will captions, are set in [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/ "Lato") by Łukasz Dziedzic, while everything else is in Impallari Type's [Libre Baskerville](http://www.impallari.com/projects/overview/libre-baskerville "Libre Baskerville").

You may have noticed that links are a [light-gray color]() with an underline---they turn green when you hover over them. Speaking of the color green, block quotes are just that.

>The gods envy us. They envy us because we’re mortal, because any moment may be our last. Everything is more beautiful because we’re doomed.

There are three different image styles: normal, full, and bleed. All images usually have captions for providing context. *Lorem Ipsum* is used between the images to convey their unique effects. [^1]

Isn't that horizontal rule really neat? The three-asterisk style was something I picked up from my favorite designer/writer, Frank Chimero. [*The Web's Grain*](http://frankchimero.com/talks/the-webs-grain/transcript/ "The Web's Grain by Frank Chimero") is highly recommended by me.

Now let's finish up.

###Here Are Some Lists###

That was a level three heading. Level three headings aren't used very much at all, but I am keeping them in my toolkit. Next, you'll see an ordered and unordered list.

1. Milk
2. Eggs
3. Cheese

- Paper beats rock
- Rock beats scissors
  - Sub-bullet
- Scissors beats paper

Footnotes are at the bottom---and by clicking on the magical number at the end of the line you are instantaneously transported there. [^2] 

>The End.

###Notes###

Footnotes go in this section, along with any general notes I may have for you, the reader. That's all from me---I hope you enjoyed our trip through type and layout!

[^1]: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
