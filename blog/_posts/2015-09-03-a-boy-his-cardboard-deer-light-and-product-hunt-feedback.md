This email found it’s way into my inbox a few days ago. It was an @mention notification for [a product](http://www.producthunt.com/tech/popup-lighting-deer-head) that only 48 people upvoted — seven months ago! For some reason, even though this awesome product was/is one of the coolest, most eclectic finds featured on Product Hunt, I had completely forgotten it.

Before I go any further, let’s take a look at the [Popup Lightning Deer Head](http://popuplighting.com/), in all it’s glory.

So you get the point — this thing is beautiful. Or, at least if you don’t like it, you can appreciate the craftsmanship and thought behind the product. It’s art! Undoubtedly rad among those that commented, there was one thing that was all too painful.

The [price](http://popuplighting.com/collections/shop/products/deer-head).

It was pointed out a lot.

##It all comes full cardboard!

Anyway, the last comment I remembered seeing was from [@abramdawson](http://twitter.com/abramdawson):

I never, ever thought that I would *actually* see this product come to life in a cardboard version (given the original material and price). Just thought it would fall flat and I would never hear about it again. But I was so content to be proven wrong.

*The* email

Yes, it’s a happy ending! But it’s really not just about a boy and his cardboard deer light — there’s so much more to the story. The story captures the PH community almost perfectly: users and makers give and receive feedback, feedback is implemented, THEN users are happy so they give more feedback to other makers.

It’s a virtuous cycle:

1. Product Hunters’ feedback is valued and respected.
2. Makers actively listen and consider this feedback.
3. More feedback is given.

It’s tough to find that *genuine* relationship on the Internet nowadays
