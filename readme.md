## Hello, GitHub!

Thanks for checking out the innards of my website, [thomasmeagher.com](http://thomasmeagher.com/)! Here's what's going on:

- Hosted using [CloudFlare](http://www.cloudflare.com) & [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
- [Syntatically Awesome Style Sheets (a.k.a Sass)](http://sass-lang.com) help make it pretty.
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) compiles my scss files and generates what you see.

Submit an issue or [tweet at me](http://twitter.com/thomasmeagher) if you have questions, comments, or just want to tell me that I did something wrong.

T.F.M
